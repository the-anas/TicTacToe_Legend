This project is about a search based Artificial Intelligence that plays tictactoe optimally. This means
that while playing against this AI, it will never lose. However, if your moves are optimal as well you 
will get a tie.
The logic for the AI is implemented in the tictactoe file, while the graphical interface is implemented 
in runner.py. To proprely run this project, run the runner.py file. (runner.py was provided by course owner)
This project is implemented as part of CS50 Artificial intelligence course. Note that distribution code
was provided for this project.
